# Open source checklist
Before going live with a public repository, the following considerations should be taken. 

- [ ] **Remove all PII**
  - Use [Clouseau](https://github.com/cfpb/clouseau) for scanning source code, pre-commit
  - Visually inspect each image to ensure there is no GSA-specific information
- [ ] **Remove all potential security sensitive information**
  - Passwords, tokens, keys, IPs, etc.
- [ ] **Consider proper use of open source code**
- [ ] **Consider/review what is proper to open source the code**
   - What kind of license should be used
   - Whether there are restrictions on what should be open sourced
- [ ] **Include GSA standard or updated `README.md`**
  - Have installation instructions documented and tried out before posting
  - Make sure to include and test all configuration dependencies
- [ ] **Include GSA standard or updated `CONTRIBUTING.md` file**
- [ ] **Include GSA standard or updated `LICENSE.md`**
- [ ] **Include an updated `codeinventory.yml`**
- [ ] **If desired, include `CHANGELOG.md`**
- [ ] **Use `.gitignore`**
- [ ] **Setup or use a standard development pipeline**
  - Look at GSA's code scanning documentation - [static_code_scan](https://github.com/GSA/open-source-policy/blob/master/OpenSource_code/static_code_scan.md) and [checkmarx_poc](https://github.com/GSA/open-source-policy/blob/master/OpenSource_code/checkmarx_poc.md) docs
  - Contact the CTO's office for support - cto@gsa.gov
